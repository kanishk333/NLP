    "# Introduction To Sentiment Analysis:-\n",
    "Sentiment analysis refers to analyzing an opinion or feelings about something using data like text or images, regarding almost anything. Sentiment analysis helps companies in their decision-making process. For instance, if public sentiment towards a product is not so good, a company may try to modify the product or stop the production altogether in order to avoid any losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many sources of public sentiment e.g. public interviews, opinion polls, surveys, etc. However, with more and more people joining social media platforms, websites like Facebook and Twitter can be parsed for public sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Problem Definition:-\n",
    "Given tweets about six US airlines, the task is to predict whether a tweet contains positive, negative, or neutral sentiment about the airline. This is a typical supervised learning task where given a text string, we have to categorize the text string into predefined categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Solution:-\n",
    "To solve this problem, we will follow the typical machine learning pipeline. We will first import the required libraries and the dataset. We will then do exploratory data analysis to see if we can find any trends in the dataset. Next, we will perform text preprocessing to convert textual data to numeric data that can be used by a machine learning algorithm. Finally, we will use machine learning algorithms to train and test our sentiment analysis models."
